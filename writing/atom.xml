        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I started Pnotions, my weekly newsletter, a couple of months ago. I composed the letters for eight weeks, publishing them on Sunday morning. </p><p>I started composing the ninth letter, as usual, that week but couldn’t get through with it. Somehow, it turned into this boring task that I had to do. It was safe composing and publishing them. It felt safe.</p><p>But I want to do something that excites and scares me, like writing this.</p><p>Getting to the topic</p><p>How do large donations work? People donate millions, even billions of dollars. Where do they go? How do they improve the current living/economic conditions of that time? These questions apply to any country. </p><p>Recently, the Adani family announced they are donating $7.7 billion (60,000 crore Indian rupees) to charity on Gautam Adani's 60th birthday. It is just one example I am taking because it is a large amount and a recent one.</p><p>It is important to realize how big donations can directly improve the living conditions of people. I will give you an example of what I mean.  </p><p>Imagine you live in a city and donated some amount to a big hospital to help them buy a few expensive (essential) machines. Those machines improve living conditions by detecting health problems or treating diseases. But it is an indirect effect. To fight this COVID pandemic, the Indian government started inoculating its people free of cost. It is an essential program (because taking the COVID vaccine is not optional) and has a direct-effect that I was discussing.</p><p>Now you know what I mean by direct and indirect effect. So back to our topic, how can we spend 60 billion rupees directly on people? While casually discussing this with a friend, I learned a new side to this story. </p><p>You can only spend so much on people without making them lazy.</p><p>Wow, a new angle. Yes, we are helping them, but how many people who are getting the help need that help? This discussion went in a new direction, tax. My friend explained how he has to pay one-third of his salary to the government (as a direct tax) because many failed to file their taxes or keep/submit wrong records of their income in our country. </p><p>This discussion got me thinking about my direct-effect approach. We need a direct impact on the country’s system, which is the core of any program. Anyway, it is a discussion for another day.</p><p>Adani family is funding essentials like healthcare, education, and skill development with this donation. It is exactly what we need. Teach people fishing instead of giving fish for free. </p><p>On that note, do not forget to file your income tax return by July 31, 2022. </p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Prashanthi</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Still don’t know</strong></p><p>You are probably wondering how I cannot know what I am writing. Well, that happens sometimes. Maybe all the time. But I am writing, which is the point.</p><p>I have to gather my thoughts on whatever this is. For now, enjoy reading it.</p><p>Okay, first, I am temporarily stopping composing my newsletter, Pnotions. I started because I was excited about it. After eight weeks, I am not anymore. I had fun composing them, all eight letters. It is time for a little break from it. I love to hear if you have any thoughts on Pnotions.</p><p>On a completely unrelated note,</p><p>Last year Gartner proposed a new term for all things DevOps in its trends, XOps. Maybe they got tired, like everyone else, hearing all these words - DevOps, DevSecOps, GitOps, MLOps, AIOps, DataOps, and Iseriouslydon’tcareOps. I mean, come on, that’s a lot of OPS.</p><p>I like XOps. It sounds cool. I am not saying it sounds like X-Men, but you get the idea.</p><p>If you think this is crazy, thank you.</p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Prashanthi</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was a very dark, stormy night (not really, but let's assume). The Data team got a DNS issue. I worked with them earlier, so I took up the task. It was about two different services from two different regions trying to connect over a global AWS DNS service, Route53.</p><p>I tried to connect them. I mean, I really tried. I googled and read/ investigated all the possible solutions. I read and applied the instructions from AWS documentation, and most importantly, Stack Overflow answers.</p><p>After hours of trying, it was a futile effort. It was almost midnight when I decided to sleep, thinking of solving it the next day.</p><p>Maybe in my efforts to solve the issue, I attracted a few evil spirits. Yes, I didn't understand that either. But, I saw phantoms and one poltergeist hanging in the air, throwing my stuff around the living room. I immediately grabbed my Pro (MacBook) from the table and clutched it. The poltergeist was so naughty. I thought it was Peeves' (from Harry Potter) cousin. They all looked like a human, formed from white smoke, translucent.</p><p>Ghosts were wreaking havoc, and suddenly I heard a bang. I turned in the direction of the loud noise, and couldn't believe my eyes. I saw John Constantine (a warlock from DC comics). Ghosts were at my place only a few minutes before he appeared. He was fast. </p><p>I greeted him and offered him a cup of coffee. He didn't take it because of his busy schedule. I didn't understand that at all (I mean, who rejects coffee? Hell can wait). He started his usual rituals to get rid of these ghosts but was troubled to concentrate on the spells. The ghosts were so busy bothering him. It was chaos everywhere.</p><p>I lost patience and started babbling about my own issues. Then the whole room went quiet. They all looked intrigued, so I started sharing the DNS issue I faced earlier. I went on and on about my attempts to solve it. Then Peeves' cousin, the poltergeist, threw a chair into the air. It landed on the floor with a bang. Peeves' bad cousin broke my chair and said, "We are leaving this place right now. We are already dead. we don't need this DNS nonsense." And they all left.</p><p>John looked at me bewildered. I was shocked too, realizing that I bored a bunch of ghosts to death. The irony was not last on me. </p><p>John came up to me and said, "Your way of getting rid of ghosts was less messy. Alright, Good Night mate." He was ready for his next assignment. I went outside with him and saw the Time ship. Gideon (advanced AI from the Time ship) was probably plotting the course for the next adventure. So, he was working with the Legends (DC Legends).</p><p>I was so excited to meet the Legends, but they were in a hurry to visit the past and whatever chaos was happening there. For a few minutes, I completely forgot about my DNS problem.</p><p>He said goodbye and boarded the ship. It hummed to life, ready to take off. Suddenly, there was a blinding light. I couldn't see anything for a second, and I woke up. It was the morning sun on my face. I went into the living room with my eyes half-closed from sleep. Everything looked normal, the furniture, my books, even the broken chair. It took me a minute to understand that it was all a dream, the ghosts, and John Constantine. Not my DNS issue. It was very real.</p><p>With that realization, I made a pot of my favorite coffee, went into the study with my The Batman cup, started resolving the DNS resolve issue.</p><p>Prashanthi</p>]]></content>
